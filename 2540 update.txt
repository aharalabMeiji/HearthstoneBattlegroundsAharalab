General Updates
You can now see how many cards your opponent has in their hand during combat.
DrekÅfThar, Greybough, NÅfZoth, Onyxia, The Jailer, and Vanndar will now only be offered in games where at least one of Beasts, Demons, Mechs, or Undead are in the minion pool.
Cyborg Drake and General Drakkisath received text-only updates to improve their clarity; neither change was a functional change.

Battlegrounds Season 5 is Here!
Competitors throughout Azeroth are gathering in the Tavern for a gladiatorial contest to earn the favor of the Titans and their keepers. With over 30 new minions, 7 opponents, and slew of new Anomalies to master, the competition has never been fiercer!



On August 22, Battlegrounds Season 4 will end and Season 5 will begin. That means rankings will reset, Battlegrounds Quests will be removed, minion pools will update, and the Battlegrounds Track will switch over. All rewards that were earned from the Season 4 Track, but not yet claimed, will automatically be claimed.

New Gameplay System—Anomalies
Battlegrounds Season 5 introduces a chaotic new seasonal system: Anomalies! Anomalies are game-changing effects that are randomly set at the start of each game. All players in the game get the same Anomaly for that game.

Anomaly appearance rates vary, with some more common than others. Some minions, minion types, and heroes won’t be offered if a particular Anomaly applies to your game. You’ll know your game’s Anomaly when you’re picking your hero.



Anomalies at Launch
There will be an initial pool of Anomalies at the Season launch, and then new Anomalies will be added to the pool each week throughout Battlegrounds Season 5. The following Anomalies will be available from the beginning of Season 5:

Prudence of Amitus	Unspent Gold carries over to your next turn. If you saved at least 5, gain 1 extra.
Anti-Gravity Stadium	Minions in the Tavern have their Attack and Health swapped.
Might of Khaz-goroth	At the end of your turn, set your left and right-most minions' Attack to the higher of the two.
Fortitude of Khaz-goroth	At the end of your turn, set your left and right-most minions' Health to the higher of the two.
Money Match	Start at 10 Gold.
Denathrius’ Anima Reserves	All heroes are Sire Denathrius.
Uncompensated Upset	Start at 1 Gold. Minions cost (1) but sell for (0). Upgrading the Tavern costs (2) less.
Secrets of Norgannon	Tavern Tier 7 exists. Start with 10 extra Armor.
Transient Treasures	At the start of your turn, choose from 2 new Quest Rewards.
Nguyen's Shifting Disks	All heroes are Master Nguyen.
Bring in the Buddies	Buddies are in the Tavern.
Oops, All _______!	
This Anomaly has a version for Beasts, Pirates, Dragons, Elementals, Mechs, Murlocs, Naga, Quilboar, Undead, and Demons. What it means is that only that minion Type and Neutrals are in the Tavern for that game. When this Anomaly is active, the number of each minion in the pool is increased to fill out the Tavern: 5x the number of each minion of the selected Type and 2x the number of each Neutral minion.

Oops, All Pirates! also has one extra adjustment: Cap’n Hoggarr is added to the minion pool. Yaharrr!

A Faire Reward	Instead of a minion, Triple Rewards Discover a Tier 1 Darkmoon Prize. (Upgrades in 3 turns!)
Finicky Hourglass	Start at Tavern Tier 2.
Packed Stands	The Tavern always has 7 minions
Double Header	The first time you buy a minion each turn, get an extra copy of it.
Echoes of Argus	Your Battlecries and Deathrattles trigger an extra time.
False Idols	You only need 2 copies of a minion to make it Golden. Instead of a Triple Reward, get a Gold Coin.
Grapnel of the Titans	The first minion you buy each turn is free.
The Golden Arena	
ALL minions are Golden, but you do not get Triple Rewards.

Dev Comment: This includes cards that are Discovered or generated by other cards.

 
Anomalies Coming Throughout Patch 27.2
Additional Anomalies will be added to the Anomaly pool each week throughout Patch 27.2. When Anomalies are newly added to the Anomaly pool, they’ll have an increased appearance rate for that week. The additional Anomalies coming throughout Patch 27.2 are:

Big League	Only Tavern Tiers 3, 4, 5, and 6 exist.
Little League	Only Tavern Tiers 1, 2, 3, and 4 exist.
Everything’s On Fire!	At the start of the game, take 30 damage. Whenever another hero dies, regain 5 Health. Dev Comment: This is fine.
Wisdom of Ulduar	At the end of every 3 turns, set your right-most minion’s stats to 15/15.
Overseer’s Orb	After you upgrade the Tavern, Refresh it with minions of your most common type.
Perfected Alchemy	Start with a “Goldenizer” that makes a friendly minion Golden.
Blood of Sargeras	At the start of your turn, set your hero’s Health to 12.
Mimiron’s Clockwork Stadium	You cannot upgrade the Tavern with Gold. It upgrades itself every 2 turns.
Path of the Treasure-Seeker	After you Refresh 5 times, find the Golden Monkey!

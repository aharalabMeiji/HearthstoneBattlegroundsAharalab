2620 update 

Battlegrounds Season 4 is Here
Are you ready to put the “band” in your warband?! Battlegrounds Season 4 is headlined by the new Rock Master Voone Hero, the new Venomous keyword, and a massive minion remix to Battlegrounds!



General Updates
On May 9, Battlegrounds Season 3 will end and Season 4 will begin. That means rankings will reset, Battlegrounds Buddies will be removed, minion pools will update, and the Battlegrounds Track will switch over. All rewards that were earned from the Season 3 Track, but not yet claimed, will automatically be claimed.
Minion types will be rolled out in phases for Season 4. On May 9, only six types will be eligible in all games: Beasts, Murlocs, Dragons, Elementals, Naga, and Undead. On May 11, Pirates will be added to the pool of eligible types. On May 15, Demons will be added to the pool of eligible types. Finally, on May 22, Quilboar and Mechs will be added to the pool of eligible types.

* Some Heroes have high winrate disparities between lower-MMR and higher-MMR players. To account for this, some heroes are given an alternative Armor value, depending on the average play level of the lobby you’re in. Any hero that only lists one Armor amount has that same Armor at all levels of play.

Keyword Updates: Poisonous, Venomous, Windfury, and Magnetic
Poisonous has been removed from Battlegrounds. A new Battlegrounds keyword, Venomous, will take its place! Venomous is like Poisonous except that only the first minion that is damaged by a Venomous minion each combat is instantly destroyed.

Mega-Windfury has also been removed from Battlegrounds. Now, when a Windfury minion is tripled, it will still have Windfury. This change is to make Windfury more in line with other keywords and to open up more design space in the future.

Finally, you can now Magnetize to your Mechs even if you have a full board (this change applies to all Modes, not just Battlegrounds). This change was made to make Mech games smoother by removing negative play experiences; it also lets us focus more on Magnetic with this update.

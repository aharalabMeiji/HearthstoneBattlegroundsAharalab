Battlegrounds Updates
Dev Comment: We're overall very pleased with the initial reception of spells! While the meta is in a relatively healthy place, we're making a wide range of lighter adjustments to tone down some overperformers (notably, most spell-generators) and to give some extra help to Quilboars, Murlocs, and Undead. We'll continue to monitor and make more adjustments as needed in the new year.

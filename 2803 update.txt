Minion Updates
Dev Comment: Most of these changes are primarily for power reasons, to curb some of the meta’s current overperforming and underperforming minions. A few of these changes are being made for more nuanced reasons, that we elaborate on below.

Goldrinn, the Great Wolf

Old: 3/3. Deathrattle: For the rest of this combat, your Beasts have +3/+3.
New: 3/2. Deathrattle: For the rest of this combat, your Beasts have +3/+2.


Banana Slamma

Old: [Tier 4] 2/5.
New: [Tier 5] 3/6.
Dev Comment: Banana Slamma is not an overwhelming power outlier, but it does tend to be a frustrating sentiment outlier, especially where one player gets too many of them too early in the game. We’ve moving it up a tier to decrease its appearance rate and make getting multple Slammas harder. We’re moving Mama Bear down a tier so that Beasts don’t lose too much overall power with this round of changes.


Mama Bear

Old: [Tier 5] 4/4. Whenever you summon a Beast, give it +4/+4.
New: [Tier 4] 3/3. Whenever you summon a Beast, give it +3/+3.


Gunpowder Courier

Old: 2/4.
New: 2/6.


Dancing Barnstormer

Old: [Tier 4] 3/2. Deathrattle: Elementals in the Tavern have +3/+2 for the rest of the game.
New: [Tier 2] 2/1. Deathrattle: Elementals in the Tavern have +1/+1 for the rest of the game.
Dev Comment: Elementals have been struggling a bit since the removal of Gusty Trumpeter. To help them out, we’re making many small adjustments across Elementals to increase their overall power without concentrating it on a single minion.


Flourishing Frostling

Old: [Tier 2] 0/6. Has +1 Attack for each Elemental you played this game (wherever this is).
New: [Tier 4] 1/1. Has +1/+1 for each Elemental you played this game (wherever this is).


Tavern Tempest

Old: [Tier 5] 4/4.
New: [Tier 4] 2/2.


Carbonic Copy

Old: [Tier 4] 3/3.
New: [Tier 5] 6/7.


Rock Rock

Old: 4/4. After you play an Elemental, give your other minions +2 Attack. (Swaps to Health next turn!)
New: 5/5. After you play an Elemental, give your minions +2 Attack. (Swaps to Health next turn!)


Diremuck Forager

Old: 4/3. Start of Combat: Give a Murloc in your hand +2/+2, then summon it for this combat only.
New: 3/4. Start of Combat: Give a minion in your hand +2/+2, then summon it for this combat only.


Bassgill

Old: [Tier 5] 8/3. Deathrattle: Summon the highest Health minion from your hand for this combat only.
New: [Tier 4] 7/2. Deathrattle: Summon the highest Health Murloc from your hand for this combat only.
Dev Comment: Both Bassgill and Diremuck Forager server an important role in Murloc comps by allowing them to summon handbuffed minions into play. However, Bassgill is often used to get other powerful minions into play, like Venomous minions or Leeroy. We’ve adjusted both cards to decrease the viability of those other comps, while keeping them viable for handbuff strategies.


Murky

Old: 6/5. Battlecry: Give a friendly Murloc +1/+1. (Improved by each Battlecry minion you played this game!)
New: 6/4. Battlecry: Give a friendly Murloc +10/+10.


Aggem Thorncurse

Old: 3/6. After a Blood Gem is played on this, give a friendly minion of each type +1/+1.
New: 3/5. After a Blood Gem is played on this, give a friendly minion of each type +2/+1.


Captain Flat Tusk

Old: 9/6. After you spend 4 Gold, get a Blood Gem.
New: 9/5. After you spend 3 Gold, get a Blood Gem.


Motley Phalanx

Old: 7/7. Taunt. Deathrattle: Give a friendly minion of each type +7/+7.
New: 5/5. Taunt. Deathrattle: Give a friendly minion of each type +5/+5.

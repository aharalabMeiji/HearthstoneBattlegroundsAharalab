Patch 28.2, launching tomorrow, brings Battlegrounds Season 6, the Spellslinger’s Saloon, updates to the shop and new player progression, and more!

Saddle Up for Battlegrounds Season 6!
Belly up to the saloon in Battlegrounds Season 6, the Spellslinger’s Saloon. This here saloon’s serving up all new spells, purchased directly from the Tavern. Sit down with over 40 new Tavern spells, over 30 new minions, an update to the Undead minion type, and more!



On December 5, Battlegrounds Season 5 will end and Season 6 will begin. That means rankings will be reset, Anomalies will be removed, and the Battlegrounds Track will switch over. All rewards that were earned from the Season 5 Track, but not yet claimed, will be automatically claimed.

New Mechanic—Tavern Spells
Battlegrounds Season 6 introduces a new Battlegrounds play experience: buying spells directly from the Tavern! Tavern spells have Tavern Tiers like minions, but, unlike minions, they have variable costs—and a new frame that shows off both their Tavern Tier and their cost at the same time.

There are 42 new Tavern spells in Patch 28.2, across all six Tavern Tiers.* Each time you Refresh the Tavern, you'll be offered a Tavern spell of your Tier or lower in addition to the number of minions you get offered for that Tavern Tier.** When you buy a Tavern spell, it’s added to your hand, for you to use whenever you want.

* There are 5 copies of each Tier 1 Tavern spell, 7 copies of each Tier 2, 9 copies of each Tier 3, 11 copies of Tier 4, 7 copies of Tier 5, and 5 copies of Tier 6. Tavern spells are returned to the pool immediately when you get them (not when you play them). Like existing Battlegrounds spells (for example, Blood Gems or Coins), you can’t triple Tavern spells and they are spent once they are used.

** If you freeze a Tavern spell, it will stay in the Tavern for the next turn and you won’t get an additional one added to the Tavern next turn. Think of it like one additional dedicated Tavern spell space being added to the board (but the max board slots is still 7—if you would have more than a full board, your Tavern spell slot will replace one of the minion slots).

Hero Updates
Vol’jin

[0 Gold] Choose 2 minions. They gain each other’s Attack until next turn.
Dev Comment: Vol’jin has been a design space limiter for some time, especially due to its interaction with aura effects like Eternal Knight or Flourishing Frostling. This change opens up more room for us to explore future minion designs while still preserving Vol’jin’s stat-changing identity. With this change, Vol’jin is no longer banned from Naga lobbies.
Ini Stormcoil

No text change, but now counts minions destroyed in the Recruit phase.
Maiev Shadowsong

[1 Gold] Choose a card in the Tavern to lock in your hand. After 2 turns, unlock it.

Battlegrounds Season 3 is Here!
Good news, everyone! Battlegrounds Season 3 brings Professor PutricideÅfs new Hero Power, Undead and dual-type minions, and tons more new and updated heroes and minions!



General Updates
On January 17, Battlegrounds Season 2 will end and Battlegrounds Season 3 will begin. That means that rankings will reset, Battlegrounds Quests will be removed, minion pools will update, and the Battlegrounds Track will switch over. All rewards that were earned, but not yet claimed, from the Season 2 Track will be automatically claimed.
The 15-damage Damage Cap will now persist until both a hero has died and the game has reached turn 8 (the 10 Gold turn).
Armor will now appear overlayed on health bars on the scoreboard.
Undead and dual-type minions have been added as a regular part of Battlegrounds. The same number of minion types will be in each Battlegrounds game (meaning an additional minion type will be excluded each game after this change). If either type of a dual-type minion is in a game, the dual-type minion will be in that game.
Undead will appear in every lobby for 2 weeks after the patch; they will then appear in 75% of lobbies for an additional 2 weeks. Then they will be part of the regular rotation of minion types.
For a short time after the launch of Undead, turns 5+ will be 5 seconds longer to allow players time to learn the new cards. This is expected to be reverted in a planned hotfix following the patch.
New Battlegrounds Track
When the new Battlegrounds Season begins, rewards on last SeasonÅfs Battlegrounds Track will no longer be able to be earned, all rewards that were earned and not yet claimed will be automatically claimed, and a new Battlegrounds Track will begin. The Season 3 Battlegrounds Track features 40 new Battle for Silvermoon themed cosmetics, including 4 Legendary Hero Skins, 3 Epic Hero Skins, 8 Rare Hero Skins, 1 Rare Board, 1 Rare Bartender, and 9 Rare Emotes!



For more details about the Season 3 Battlegrounds Track, see our Season 3 Announcement Blog.


Hero Updates
Professor Putricide has been reworked with new art and a whole new Hero Power for his return to the Hero Pool!

Professor Putricide

Build-An-Undead
[4 Gold] Craft a custom Undead. (3 Creations left!)


?Dev Comment: When you build an Undead, youÅfll be offered two sets of 3 minions to merge together. One set tends to have persistent in-combat rules while the other set tends to have keywords and in-shop effects. All minion offerings will be at or below your Tavern Tier. The Build-An-Undead pools include both minions that are available in BobÅfs Tavern and minions that are unique to this effect. PutricideÅfs creations are unnatural, so they canÅft be tripled.

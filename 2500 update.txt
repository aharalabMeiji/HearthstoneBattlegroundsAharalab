Battlegrounds Updates
The following updates will go live with Patch 25.0, on November 29.

New Hero

Enhance-o-Mechano (Armor Tier 1)

Enhancification
Passive. After each Refresh, give a minion in Bob's Tavern Taunt, Reborn, Windfury, or Divine Shield.
Dev Comments: The odds for each enhancification are equal (25%), except that a minion won't be given a keyword it already has. So if ALL minions in a shop offering already have one of the keywords, it will roll something else.


This new hero will be available in all lobbies for two weeks after patch launch.

New Quest Reward

Enhance-a-matic: At the start of your turn, get an Enhanced Part that gives +5/+5 and a random bonus.



Enhanced Parts:

Mega Horn: Give a minion +5/+5 and Taunt.


Blazing Blades: Give a minion +5/+5 and Windfury.


Bunker Plating: Give a minion +5/+5 and Divine Shield.


Death Rewinder: Give a minion +5/+5 and Reborn.


Dev Comment: The odds for each of the Enhanced Parts are equal (25%).

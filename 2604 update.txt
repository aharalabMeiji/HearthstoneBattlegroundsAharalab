Buddy Updates
Dev Comment: This is our last expected patch of this Buddies meta. Battlegrounds Season 4 is coming soon with Patch 26.2. When it does, Buddies will be removed again to make room for a massive minion shakeup. But don’t worry, we’ll see our Buddies again one day. For now, hang tight. Season 4 details are right around the corner!

Bilgewater Mogul (Trade Prince Gallywix’s Buddy)

Old: [Tavern Tier 3]
New: [Tavern Tier 4]


Magnus Manastorm (Millhouse Manastorm’s Buddy)

Old: [Tavern Tier 4]
New: [Tavern Tier 5]


Nightmare Ectoplasm (Mutanus the Devourer’s Buddy)

Old: [Tavern Tier 4] 4 Attack, 3 Health. When you ‘Devour’ this, spit its stats onto 2 extra minions.
New: [Tavern Tier 3] 5 Attack, 4 Health. When you ‘Devour’ this, spit its state onto 1 extra minion.


And the quest gained from Shady Aristocrat (Sire Denathrius’s Buddy) has again been made harder to complete.

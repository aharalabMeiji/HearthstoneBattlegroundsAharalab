General Update
You can now favorite multiple Hero Skins per Hero to get a random one of your favorites at the start of each game. Now you can bring even more great looks to the Tavern!

New Anomalies
Additional Anomalies will be added to the Anomaly pool each week throughout Patch 27.6. When Anomalies are newly added to the Anomaly pool, they’ll have an increased appearance rate for that week. This is our last planned infusion of new Anomalies this Battlegrounds Season!

The following Anomalies are being added to the Anomaly pool with Patch 27.6:

Anomalous Wisdomball	Starting on Turn 6, you occasionally get helpful Refreshes!
Anomalous Twin	Start of combat: Summon a copy of your highest-Health minion.
Anomalous Bribe	After you sell a minion, give its stats to a minion in the Tavern.
The Keys to Victory	After you play a minion, give your other minions +1/+1 for each Keyword they share with it.
Bring Home the Bacon	Start with two upgrading Piggy Banks. Break them open to gain Gold!
Piggy Bank: Gain 1 Gold. (Upgrades each turn!)
Temperance of Aman'Thul	Start at Tavern Tier 4. Gain 10 extra Gold on your first turn only.
Audience's Choice	At the start of each turn, one player chooses a card of ANY Tier for ALL players to get at end of turn.
The additional Anomalies coming throughout Patch 27.6 are:

What Are the Odds?	Only Tavern Tiers 1, 3, and 5 exist. Triple rewards Discover a minion of your Tier.
How to Even??	Only Tavern Tiers 2, 4, and 6 exist. Triple rewards Discover a minion of your Tier.

Treasure Hoard	On Turn 8, Discover a Golden Tier 6 minion.

No Place Like Holmes	Each turn, look at 2 minions. Guess which one your next opponent had last combat for a Coin.
No Face, No Case	Every 4 turns, Get a 'Faceless Manipulator' that copies a minion of your choice.
Faceless Manipulator: [Tier 1] 3/3. Battlecry: Choose a minion and become a copy of it.
Eleventh Hour	The first time your hero takes fatal damage, prevent it and gain 11 Gold next turn instead.

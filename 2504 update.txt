Quest Reward Updates

The Kidnap Sack Quest Reward has been made harder to earn.
The Hidden Treasure Vault and Teal Tiger Sapphire Quest Rewards have been made easier to earn.
The Partner in Crime, Pilfered Lamps, Wondrous Wisdomball, and Yogg-tastic Tasties Quest Rewards will appear more frequently.
Dev Comment: As we approach the end of the season, we want all players to have a chance to experience some of the rarer Quests they may or may not have been able to find. Enjoy!

Minion Updates

Toxfin*
Old: Tavern Tier 4
New: Tavern Tier 6


Dev Comment: Though not a power outlier at most levels, Toxfin has a limiting effect on what playstyles feel viable in Murloc lobbies. We are pushing Toxfin up to Tier 6 as a way to open up some space for more diverse strategies.

Interrogator Whitemane *have been removed from the minion pool.
Witchwing Nestmatron, *
Mechano-Egg, *
